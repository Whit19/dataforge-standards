### ISS-117 — Skins opt-in cutoff
**Status:** Resolved
**Description:** Skins opt-in was closing too early when scores were present 
rather than waiting for round lock.
**Resolution:** `isClosed = round?.isLocked` — round lock is the only cutoff. 
`hasScores` prop removed from `SkinsOptInCard`. Verified in dry run 2026-06-04.

### ISS-118 — In-app PDF guides
**Status:** Resolved
**Description:** Players needed access to App Setup and User Guide documentation 
from within the app.
**Resolution:** Two PDFs uploaded to Firebase Storage (`Guides/` folder). Two 
cards added to Info screen under a "GUIDES" section label. Tap opens PDF in 
device viewer. Deployed 2026-06-04.

### ISS-136 — Add Dining Event Save button unreachable (iOS PWA)
**Status:** Resolved
**Description:** On the "Add Dining Event" form (InfoScreen), the Save/Cancel 
buttons below the Notes field were unreachable on iOS PWA standalone. The modal 
content extended past the visible viewport behind the fixed bottom nav, and 
neither the modal nor the background page would scroll vertically to reveal it 
(horizontal scroll worked, vertical did not).
**Resolution:** Converted `AnnouncementModal` and `DiningEventModal` (both used 
the shared `.modal-overlay`/`.modal` floating overlay pattern) to inline forms 
(`AnnouncementForm`, `DiningEventForm`) shown in-page when `showForm` is true, 
matching the existing `NotesTab` pattern. No floating overlay remains in 
`InfoScreen.jsx`. See DEC-136 for full investigation/attempts.

### ISS-140 — Players couldn't see live Skins standings on Money screen
**Status:** Resolved
**Description:** Discovered after the R1 dry run in production: the Money >
Skins tab showed "Skins results will appear as scores are entered" for every
player, every round, regardless of actual score data, while admins saw the full
live pot/standings/hole-by-hole board on the same screen. Winnings tab was
unaffected.
**Resolution:** Root cause was `firestore.rules` — the `payments` read rule
(`allow read: if isAdmin() || request.auth.uid == resource.data.playerId`) only
permits reading one's own payment doc. `useSkins.js` queries ALL payment docs at
once (`queries.paymentsForOuting`) to build the skins opt-in roster; Firestore
rejects any such broad query for a non-admin under a per-document-owner rule, so
the listener silently failed and `payments` stayed `[]` client-side for every
player. Changed read rule to `allow read: if isSignedIn()` in both the
`outings/{outingId}/payments` and top-level `payments` blocks. Write access
unchanged. See DEC-139.
