**Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Category:** Technical | **Status:** Final

---

## DEC-118 — AdminFoursomes: Team Split UI + Match Doc Sync on Save
**Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Category:** Feature / Architecture | **Status:** Final

---

## DEC-119 — Firestore Doc ID Prefixes: G for Foursomes, M for Matches
**Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Category:** Architecture | **Status:** Final

---

## DEC-120 — Skins Opt-In Cutoff: Round Lock Only
**Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Category:** UX | **Status:** Final

---

## DEC-121 — Scramble Team Names: Admin-Only via AdminFoursomes
**Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Category:** UX / Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Removed player-facing `TeamNameEditor` component from `Foursomes.jsx`. Team names are set exclusively by admins in AdminFoursomes. Player-facing entry had multiple issues and is not worth maintaining. `teamName` field remains on `scrambleTeams` docs.

---

## DEC-122 — r3Leaderboard Derived from scrambleResults
**Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Category:** Technical | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** `r3Leaderboard` useMemo now derives from `scrambleResults` rather than sorting `r3Scores` independently. This ensures the Leaderboard R3 tab and MoneyScreen scramble results always show identical ranking. `rank` uses `s.place` (tiebreaker-aware) instead of array index. `scrambleResults` must be declared before `r3Leaderboard` in `useLeaderboard.js` — wrong order causes ReferenceError.

---

## DEC-123 — Default Tab to Active Round: Leaderboard + MoneyScreen
**Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Category:** UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Both `LeaderboardScreen` and `MoneyScreen` now default to the currently active round on load. `LeaderboardScreen` reads `outing.status` and maps to tab key (`round1`→`r1` etc.). `MoneyScreen` uses last locked round among 2/3/4 (default 2 if none locked). Both use a `hasDefaulted`/`hasDefaultedWin` ref so the default fires once only and doesn't override user tab changes mid-session. `hasDefaultedSkins` added for Skins tab.

---

## DEC-124 — Tiebreaker Scores Displayed in Leaderboard and MoneyScreen
**Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Category:** UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Tiebreaker detail shown whenever two or more players/teams share the same gross score (`.some()` check, not `.every()`). Labels: `Back 9 Score: ##` or `Last 3 Holes Score: ##`. Applies to R3 tab (scramble teams), R1/R2/R4 RoundTab, and ScrambleResultsList in MoneyScreen. Shown for ALL tied entries, not just winner. Required attaching `backNine` and `lastThree` to R1/R2/R4 row objects. R1 rows attach these directly (R1 bypasses `sortWithTiebreaker`).

---

## DEC-125 — Dashboard Round Format Text: Dynamic via FORMAT_LABELS
**Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Category:** UX / Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** `STATUS_CONFIG` no longer hardcodes format description text for round1–round4 entries. Text is derived in JSX from `FORMAT_LABELS[activeRound?.format]`, falling back to `cfg.text` for setup/complete statuses. Prevents drift if round format is changed in Firestore (e.g. R4 was showing "Combined gross 2v2" instead of "Best Ball 2v2").

---

## DEC-126 — Complete Round: Player Confirmation + completedAt on Foursome Doc
**Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Category:** Feature / Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** "Complete Round" button appears in `ScoreEntry.jsx` when all 18 holes are entered for all players (or round is already locked). Player taps button → confirmation panel shows per-player gross/to-par summary → on confirm, `completedAt: serverTimestamp()` written to foursome doc. Dashboard reads `myFoursome.completedAt != null || activeRound.isLocked` to show Round Complete card. Rainout/early-lock handled cleanly: admin locks round → `isLocked` drives complete state regardless of holes played. `completedAt` field preserved for future use.

---

## DEC-127 — Winnings Gated on Round Lock in Dashboard and MoneyScreen
**Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Category:** UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Winnings are only shown once the corresponding round is locked by admin. In Dashboard `myWinnings` useMemo: R2 match winnings gated on R2 locked, scramble on R3 locked, R4 match on R4 locked, skins per-round lock. In MoneyScreen `WinningsTab`: results replaced with "Results will appear once Round X is locked" placeholder until round is locked. Prevents showing live/changing winnings mid-round.

---

## DEC-128 — Font Consistency: UI Font for All Leaderboard Numbers
**Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Category:** UX / Technical | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Removed `font-family: var(--font-mono)` from `.lb-table__seed-num`, `.lb-table__score`, `.lb-table__tpar` in `index.css`. All leaderboard numbers now use `var(--font-ui)` for visual consistency. Admin screens that display code-like data (`AdminBulkImport`, `AdminRoundSetup`, `AdminPlayers`) use `var(--font-mono)` explicitly. Bare `'monospace'` strings replaced with `var(--font-mono)`. Redundant `fontFamily: 'inherit'` removed from `AdminPayments`, `AdminPanel`, `InfoScreen`.

---

## DEC-129 — Chat Scroll to Bottom on Load and New Messages
**Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Category:** UX / Technical | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** `ChatThread.jsx` rewrote scroll-to-bottom logic. Initial load uses `setTimeout(0)` to fire after React paint. Each unloaded image gets `img.addEventListener('load', scrollToBottom)` to handle photos loading after initial scroll. Fixes Main Chat not scrolling to bottom when images are present. Back button moved to right side of thread header, labeled `← Back`.

---

## DEC-130 — Foursomes R2/R4: Holes Thru Indicator on Match Cards
**Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Category:** UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Added "Thru X" indicator to R2/R4 team match cards in `Foursomes.jsx`. Single indicator per match shown in the VS column below match status. Computed as max thru across all four players in the match. Matches the existing R1 "Thru X" pattern.

---

## DEC-131 — Three-State Round: scoringOpen Field Added to Round Doc
**Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Category:** Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Added `scoringOpen: boolean` field to round docs alongside existing `isLocked`. Three states: Scheduled (`!isLocked && !scoringOpen`), Scoring (`!isLocked && scoringOpen`), Locked (`isLocked`). Both fields always written together via `updateDoc(docRefs.round(...), { isLocked: newLocked, scoringOpen: newScoringOpen })`. All existing `isLocked` gates (winnings, skins, prize calc, Complete Round) unchanged.

---

## DEC-132 — Three-State Round: Admin Tile Cycle with Sequential Enforcement
**Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Category:** UX / Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Admin round tile tapping cycles Scheduled → Scoring → Locked → Scheduled. Sequential rules: advancing to Scoring requires previous round ≥ Scoring or locked (R1 always ok); advancing to Locked requires previous round Locked; unlocking (Locked → Scheduled) requires next round not Locked. Tile shows calendar icon (blue-gray) for Scheduled, open lock (green) for Scoring, closed lock (red) for Locked. Hint text: "Tap to cycle: Scheduled → Scoring → Locked".

---

## DEC-133 — Dashboard Player View: Three States Tied to Round State
**Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Category:** UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Player Dashboard tee time section has three distinct states:
1. **Enter Scores** — shown when `!isLocked && scoringOpen`. Shows tee time card + "⛳ Enter Round X Scores" button.
2. **Scores Submitted** — shown when `myScoresSubmitted && !isLocked`. `myScoresSubmitted = myFoursome?.completedAt != null && !!(scoresByRound[activeRoundNum]?.some(s => s.playerId === user?.uid))`. Shows "✅ Scores Submitted / Waiting for round to be finalized…".
3. **Round Complete** — shown when `myFoursomeComplete = activeRound?.isLocked ?? false`. Shows "✅ Round X Complete" card with gross/to-par, group members, "View Groups →".
Dual condition on `myScoresSubmitted` prevents showing submitted state after scores are wiped.

---

## DEC-134 — Tournament Complete: Manual Admin Action, Decoupled from R4 Lock
**Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Category:** Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** R4 locking no longer auto-advances `outing.status` to `complete`. The status sync `useEffect` in Dashboard now derives max status as `round4` (not `complete`) when all 4 rounds are locked. A "🏆 Lock Tournament" button appears in Admin Controls when all 4 rounds are locked and status is not yet `complete`. Writes `status = 'complete'` on tap. Same button becomes "🔓 Reopen Tournament" when `status === 'complete'`, writing `status = 'round4'`. This gives admins control over when the TournamentSummaryCard appears.

---

## DEC-135 — Tournament Status Card: Dynamic Title from Round State
**Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Category:** UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** STATUS_CONFIG no longer provides static title/color/icon for round1–round4. These are computed dynamically as `displayTitle`, `displayColor`, `displayIcon` based on active round state: "Round X Scheduled" + gray when `!scoringOpen && !isLocked`; "Round X UNDERWAY" + green when `scoringOpen`; "Round X Complete" + gold when `isLocked`. setup/complete statuses still use static STATUS_CONFIG values.


---

## DEC-136 — Post-Freeze Exception: Dining/Announcement Modals → Inline Forms
**Date:** 2026-06-13 | **Category:** Architecture / UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Code freeze (per SessionStarter, citing "DEC-122") was exempted for a critical pre-outing UX fix. `AnnouncementModal` and `DiningEventModal` in `InfoScreen.jsx` (both rendered via the shared `.modal-overlay`/`.modal` floating overlay pattern) were converted to inline forms — `AnnouncementForm` and `DiningEventForm` — shown in-page when `showForm` is true, hiding the list, matching the existing `NotesTab`/`RulesTab` pattern. No modal overlay remains in `InfoScreen.jsx`.
**Rationale:** On iOS PWA standalone, the floating `.modal-overlay`/`.modal` pattern made the Save button on the "Add Dining Event" form unreachable — the modal's bottom (including Save) was hidden behind the fixed bottom nav, and neither the modal nor the background scrolled to reveal it. Multiple CSS-only fixes were attempted and reverted (see "Attempts" below) before converting to the inline-form pattern resolved it completely with no side effects.
**Attempts considered/reverted:**
1. Added `body.modal-open { position: fixed; overflow: hidden; width: 100% }` + `useModalScrollLock` hook — caused `.bottom-nav` (also `position: fixed`) to become contained by `body`'s new fixed positioning, so the nav scrolled/translated with the modal instead of staying pinned to the viewport. Reverted.
2. Tried `.modal-overlay { overflow-y: auto }` + `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` on both `.modal-overlay` and `.modal` — did not resolve gesture capture on iOS.
3. Diagnostic test (`max-height: 70dvh; background: red` on `.modal`) confirmed `.modal` itself sizes correctly relative to viewport and sits above the bottom nav by z-index — the issue was purely overlay-pattern scroll behavior on iOS standalone, not z-index or `dvh` miscalculation.
**Resolution:** `.modal`/`.modal-overlay` CSS fully reverted to pre-session state. `useModalScrollLock.js` deleted. `InfoScreen.jsx`: `AnnouncementModal`/`DiningEventModal` replaced with inline `AnnouncementForm`/`DiningEventForm` cards, toggled via `showForm` state — same pattern as `NotesTab`.
**Alternatives considered:** JS-measured viewport height via `window.visualViewport` instead of `dvh` — not needed once inline-form pattern was adopted.
**Note:** SessionStarter.md's code-freeze line cites "DEC-122", but DEC-122 in this log is "r3Leaderboard Derived from scrambleResults" — these do not match. This appears to be a pre-existing citation error in SessionStarter.md, unrelated to this session's work. Flagged for correction, not altered here.
**Status:** Final — pattern (inline forms over floating modals for full-page forms on mobile/iOS PWA) should be the default going forward; documented in BestMethods/TechnicalArchitecture.

---

## DEC-137 — Player Profile Card on Info Screen
**Date:** 2026-06-16 | **Category:** Feature / UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Added a "My Profile" card to the Info screen home grid (full width,
above the INFO section). Tapping opens a `ProfileEditModal` bottom sheet with
selfie upload + phone number + favorite casino game + firstYear (admin only).
Photo uploads to Firebase Storage `profiles/{uid}/selfie.jpg`; URL saved to
`users/{uid}.profilePhotoUrl`. `yearsPlayed` is always computed from `firstYear`
as `currentYear - firstYear + 1` — never stored. `firstYear` set by admins only;
set for all 32 players via one-time bulk script. Modal uses flex-column layout
with scrollable fields area and sticky Save/Cancel footer to prevent buttons
being obscured by content or bottom nav. Modal z-index: 2000. Footer
padding-bottom: `calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 72px)`.

---

## DEC-138 — Players Directory Screen
**Date:** 2026-06-16 | **Category:** Feature / UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Added `PlayersScreen.jsx` at `/players` route — a 2-column tile
grid showing all 32 enrolled players. Navigated to from an "All Players" card
in the Info screen INFO section. Data loaded lazily via `useAllPlayers.js` hook
(`onSnapshot` on `queries.enrolledPlayers(outingId)` — only fires when screen
mounts). Default sort: years descending; admins float to top naturally because
they have the most years. Sort controls: Years / First name / Last name. Each
tile shows: photo or initials avatar, name, years badge, admin badge, phone
(tap-to-call), favorite casino game. Initials color is deterministic from
displayName char-code hash — consistent per player across sessions. Admin badge
driven by `ADMIN_DISPLAY_NAMES` constant — never hardcoded.

---

## DEC-139 — Payments Collection Read Rule Opened to All Signed-In Players
**Date:** 2026-06-21 | **Category:** Security / Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** `payments` Firestore read rule (both the `outings/{outingId}/payments`
subcollection block and the top-level fallback block) changed from
`allow read: if isAdmin() || request.auth.uid == resource.data.playerId` to
`allow read: if isSignedIn()`. Write access unchanged — remains
`isAdmin() || request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.playerId`. Players can
now read every player's payment doc, including `entryFeePaid`, `skinsOptIns`,
and `paidOutFlags` — not just their own.
**Rationale:** Post-freeze exception found after R1. `useSkins.js` builds live
skins standings via `queries.paymentsForOuting` — a broad query across all
payment docs. Firestore rejects any query that could return documents outside
what the per-document read rule permits, so for non-admins the entire query
silently failed (no error handler), leaving `payments` permanently `[]` on the
client. This made `skinsByRound[round]` permanently `null` for every player, so
`SkinsTable.jsx` showed its empty state ("Skins results will appear as scores
are entered") regardless of actual score data — admins, who pass `isAdmin()`,
were the only ones who ever saw the live board. Tom confirmed it's acceptable
for all 32 players (a private friend group) to see each other's payment/paid-out
status in exchange for the simplest fix.
**Alternatives considered:** Restructuring `skinsOptIns` into a separate,
less-sensitive doc/collection readable by all while keeping `entryFeePaid`/
`paidOutFlags` admin-only — rejected as unnecessary scope/risk this close to R2
given the privacy tradeoff was acceptable.
**Note:** Root cause confirmed via code trace (`MoneyScreen.jsx`,
`AdminPayments.jsx`, `useSkins.js`, `SkinsTable.jsx` — all use identical logic,
no `isAdmin` branching anywhere in the UI layer) plus `firestore.rules` — this
was a rules-only bug, not a UI gating difference. Winnings tab (`WinningsTab` in
`MoneyScreen.jsx`) was unaffected — it only reads `rounds`/`matches`/
`scrambleResults`/`outing`, none of which are payments-gated, and is correctly
gated by round lock per DEC-127 identically for all users.

## DEC-140 — Tournament Results PDF Export
**Date:** 2026-06-24 | **Category:** Feature / Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Built a client-rendered tournament results page at `/results-pdf`
(admin, with print button) and `/history/:year` (player-accessible, no print button).
Single component `TournamentResultsPDF.jsx` uses `useLocation` to detect route and
conditionally show the print bar. Admin Panel home screen shows "📄 Export Results PDF"
button when `outing.status === 'complete'`. User taps browser print → Save as PDF.
No Cloud Function, no Firebase Storage upload, no file management needed.
**Sections:** Tournament header + courses + purse; age group winners; notable
achievements (low round, most birdies, eagles); quick-nav anchor links; final
standings (all 32 players); top 5 overall/prize/skins; per-round leaderboards
R1–R4 with match results; skins hole-by-hole per opted-in round.
**Skins table:** Transposed — players as rows, holes 1–18 as columns, skins won
count in final column. Skins sections use `@page landscape` print CSS. Only
opted-in players shown (correct by design — skins is an optional buy-in).
**Print CSS:** `.bottom-nav`, `.sync-bar`, `.app__main` hidden via `@media print`.
Quick-nav links hidden in print via `.no-print` class.
**Data sources:** `useLeaderboard`, `useSkins`, `useOutingSetup`, round docs
(onSnapshot), score docs (onSnapshot). All prize calculations reuse existing
`calculatePrizePools`, `calculateScramblePrizes`, `prizePerMatchWinner` from
`prizes.js`. Top 5 prize/skins logic ported directly from `TournamentSummaryCard`
in `Dashboard.jsx`.
**Alternatives considered:** Cloud Function PDF generation (puppeteer/pdfkit) —
rejected as unnecessary complexity; browser print-to-PDF is indistinguishable for
sharing purposes.

## DEC-141 — History Entry Point in Info Screen
**Date:** 2026-06-24 | **Category:** Feature / UX | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Added a 🏆 History card to the Info screen home grid. Tapping
navigates to `/history/2026` using the same navigate-not-setActiveSection pattern
as the existing Players card. Route `/history/:year` added to `App.jsx` without
AdminGuard — any logged-in player can view results. When Phase 8A builds the
`historicalTournaments` Firestore collection, the `/history` route (no year param)
will render a year-picker list; tapping a year navigates to `/history/:year`.
Currently `/history/2026` renders live 2026 data via `TournamentResultsPDF`;
future years will render from historical import data once Phase 8A is complete.

---

## DEC-142 — Historical Data Import Schema
**Date:** 2026-06-24 | **Category:** Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** Historical data (2011–2025) stored in dedicated Firestore collections
separate from live tournament collections to avoid collisions with Phase 8A
multi-tournament architecture. Collections: `historicalTournaments/{year}`,
`historicalResults/{year}_{roundNumber}_{playerName}`,
`historicalStandings/{year}_{playerName}`, `historicalPlayers/{playerName}`,
`courses/{courseName}_{tees}`.
**Source:** `UP_Golf_Historical_Import_v3.xlsx` — 6-sheet Excel (Tournaments,
Players, Courses, Rounds, Results, Standings). Tom audited and confirmed final.
**Import method:** One-time Node.js script reads Excel via xlsx library, writes
to Firestore. Script to be built in Phase 8A.
**Key schema decisions:**
- `payout` in Results = per-round only (never tournament total)
- `finalRank` lives in Standings sheet only, not Results
- `yearsPlayed` stored as comma-separated year list; `yearsCount` computed from length
- `tees` per player per round (required for future handicap calc)
- `gameFormat` controlled vocabulary: `stroke_individual`, `stroke_stableford`,
  `better_ball_gross`, `better_ball_stableford`, `scramble_2team`…`scramble_8team`,
  `better_ball_match`
- `handicapUsed`: Y / N / Unknown per round
- Courses sheet: one row per course+tee combo with slope + rating (pre-filled
  from web research for all 5 UP Golf courses; Royal St Patrick's flagged for
  scorecard verification)

## DEC-143 — CC Prompts Always Delivered as Downloadable MD Files
**Date:** 2026-06-24 | **Category:** Process | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** All CC prompts are delivered as downloadable `.md` files via
`create_file` tool, never as inline chat text. Naming convention:
`CC_[ShortDescription].md`. All files presented together via `present_files`
at end of the code-delivery step. This was added to MASTER_CLAUDE_PROTOCOL.md
section 4. Applies to all projects, all sessions.
**Rationale:** MD files can be opened and copied in full without scrolling or
truncation risk; files persist in session for reference if Claude Code needs
to be re-run; naming makes it clear which file each prompt targets.

---

## DEC-144 — Session Docs Fetched via GitHub URLs, Never Uploaded Manually
**Date:** 2026-06-24 | **Category:** Process / Architecture | **Status:** Final
**Decision:** All project docs (SessionStarter, DecisionLog, IssuesTracker,
ProjectRoadmap, TechnicalArchitecture, BestMethods, TimeLog) moved to the
public `dataforge-standards` GitHub repo under `up-golf-pwa/` subfolder.
MASTER_CLAUDE_PROTOCOL.md lives at the repo root. Claude fetches all docs
via `web_fetch` at session start using raw GitHub URLs configured in the
Claude Project Instructions field. No manual file uploads ever needed.
Session end: Claude generates CC prompt MD files → Tom pastes into Claude Code
→ commits and pushes `dataforge-standards` → live for next session automatically.
**Rationale:** Eliminates manual upload friction, ensures Claude always has
latest committed version, single source of truth in GitHub.
