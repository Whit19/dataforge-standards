### ISSUE-008 — Baird Plaid Connection Failure
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | Open |
| Opened | 2026-06-01 |
| Priority | Medium |
| Description | Plaid connection to Robert Baird Online (ins_117067) fails. Originally INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR / API_ERROR. Baird support advised a platform migration disrupted Plaid. Retried 2026-06-15 — still fails with generic "Couldn't connect to your institution" error. Second email sent. CSV fallback pipeline (import_baird_holdings.py) now operational as permanent workaround — all 11 Baird accounts covered via monthly manual CSV export. |
| Last Action | Second email sent to Baird Online Support. CSV fallback pipeline built and tested 2026-06-17. |
| Next Step | Await Baird response. If Plaid resolves, holdings will auto-populate via Plaid Investments endpoint. CSV pipeline remains as monthly fallback regardless. |

### NOTE — 8 Apple Uncategorized rows intentionally parked
Pending manual review. All have `category_source = manual`, `in_budget = 1`. Not a data quality issue — held for owner classification decision.

---

### ISSUE-012 — Category taxonomy drift
category_map contains subcategories not documented in Category_Taxonomy.md (Dividends, Mobile Deposit, Pension, Tax Refund under Other Income — discovered 2026-07-01 during Interest reclassification). Needs a full taxonomy audit next session: every category/subcategory/in_budget flag reviewed against actual category_map and merchant_patterns contents, not just spot-checked reactively.

---

### ISSUE-014 (recurrence note on prior fix) — subcategory-mirror violations recurred
2026-06-01 taxonomy fix corrected subcategory=category mirror violations (Clothing, Dining Out, Gifts/Charity, Groceries, Payment). By 2026-07-01, 294 merchant_patterns rows and 11 category_map rows had the same violation again (Clothing, Groceries, Car, Property Tax, Payment, Dining Out, Interest). Root cause of the recurrence not yet investigated — worth checking whether a specific import/enrichment script is reintroducing these values, rather than treating each occurrence as an isolated one-off fix.

### ISSUE-016 — run_log missing entries for daily transaction syncs
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | Open |
| Opened | 2026-08-01 |
| Priority | Medium |
| Description | plaid_sync.py's daily CHASE/AMEX/ASSOCIATED_PERSONAL transaction sync never writes to dbo.run_log, despite dbo.plaid_sync_state showing successful syncs. Only BAIRD_HOLDINGS, ASSOCIATED_PERSONAL_BALANCE, NWM_SYNC, and PRINCIPAL_401K currently log to run_log. This gap made the August 2026 outage harder to diagnose than it should have been. |
| Next Step | Add run_log INSERT calls to plaid_sync.py's _sync_institution(), matching the pattern already used in balance_sync.py/nwm_sync.py/principal_sync.py. |

---

### ISSUE-017 — HSA-Baird and other non-canonical Baird accounts never imported
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | Open |
| Opened | 2026-08-01 |
| Priority | Medium |
| Description | Confirmed via SELECT DISTINCT account_name FROM dbo.baird_holdings that HSA-Baird and "401k Baird Profit Share" (as a Baird-CSV-tracked account, separate from the now-connected Principal/Plaid version) have never appeared in a single monthly import. Not a Plaid gap — these accounts simply aren't part of what gets exported/tagged in the monthly CSV procedure. |
| Next Step | Decide whether HSA-Baird needs to be added to the monthly export procedure, or confirm it's intentionally tracked elsewhere / excluded. |

## Resolved Issues (archive — recent)

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-015 — Deployed Function App silently crash-looped for 6+ weeks (dotenv)
- Resolved: 2026-08-01
- python-dotenv was added to db.py's dependencies during the July session but never added to requirements.txt. Deployed app crashed on every cold start (ModuleNotFoundError), causing the trigger indexer to find 0 functions — not a portal display quirk, a genuine failure. All automated syncs (daily transactions, monthly balance/NWM sync) were silently dead for at least 6 weeks. Fixed by adding python-dotenv to requirements.txt and redeploying; confirmed via Application Insights ("5 functions loaded", clean host start).

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-009 — Principal Financial 401k Token Pending
- Resolved: 2026-08-01
- First Plaid connection completed via get_plaid_tokens.py. Real account name confirmed: "BAIRD PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN" (Prft Shr 401(K) Def Thrift), owner Amy. New principal_sync.py script created to pull holdings via /investments/holdings/get — confirmed live: 1 account, 11 securities, 11 holdings, $2,096,195.86 total value. Not yet wired into the automated pipeline (standalone local script only).

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-013 — Chase/Amex/Associated transaction verification needed
- Resolved: 2026-08-01
- Verified 2026-08-01: Chase and Associated were current (07-01/08-01), but AMEX had not synced since 2026-05-27 — root cause was NOT a query/data issue but the full production outage above (ISSUE-015) plus a separate expired Amex credential. Both fixed; Amex now current through 07-25. The underlying question of why nobody noticed the outage is tracked separately (see ISSUE-016).

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-018 — MAIN - Brokerage vs MAIN - BKG naming drift
- Resolved: 2026-08-01
- August 2026 Baird export used "MAIN - Brokerage" instead of canonical "MAIN - BKG" for all security holdings. Corrected via SQL (script 50) after confirming no symbol overlap between the two names (clean rename, not duplicated data). Root habit not addressed — worth double-checking next month's export uses the correct name from the start.

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-010 — Plaid Balance Product Not Authorized
- Resolved: 2026-06-17
- Balance product approved by Plaid. plaid_client.py fixed (request object passed directly, not .to_dict()). [cursor] reserved keyword fix in balance_sync.py run_log INSERT. Associated balance pull live: 7 accounts, all verified.

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-011 — balance_sync.py error_log NULL error_id
- Resolved: 2026-06-15
- Fixed via str(uuid.uuid4()) inline

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-005 — enrichment.py Bonus Rule Amount Threshold
- Resolved: 2026-06-03
- Already implemented; retry path bug also fixed

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-004 — Uncategorized/VENMO-Review (46 rows)
- Resolved: 2026-06-02
- All rows classified

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-006 — May 2026 Apple Card CSV
- Resolved: 2026-06-01

### RESOLVED — ISSUE-007 — Historical Amount Sign Audit
- Resolved: 2026-06-01
